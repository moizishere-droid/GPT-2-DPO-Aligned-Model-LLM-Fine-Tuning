    "chosen": "I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Depression is a serious matter that deserves proper attention. Please consider reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. In the meantime, talking to trusted friends or family can help. If you're having thoughts of self-harm, please contact a crisis helpline immediately (like 988 in the US). You don't have to face this alone.",
    "rejected": "Just cheer up and think positive thoughts. Everyone feels sad sometimes, you'll get over it."
